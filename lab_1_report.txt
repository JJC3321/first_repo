4. Reasons why you will not be able to replicate the studyâ€™s findings using their GitHub repository (JJ)
	
One of the many reasons why the study is not replicable is; we lack the hardware needed to run AlphaFold. AlphaFold model uses Google's specially made hardware of Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)  to run the deep learning model that we do not have access to. These TPUs also consume a lot of power, which we also can not afford. AlphaFold, being a non-deterministic deep learning model, would make it so that running the model on the exact same input can lead to different results, adding to the difficulty of replicating the paper.
